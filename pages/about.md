# About

Hi, I'm Yosh (or यशोधन) and I 'm a full-stack engineer, I draw upon my interests in art, design and anthropology to bring a unique perspective to the trade.

I'm currently based in Philadelphia, PA. Aside from code, I enjoy taking photographs, seeking new food adventures, traveling, and playing music.
